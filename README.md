# MachineLearning with regression and classification
I have attached an ipynb file with code and explanation along with the csv files used as the datasets.
You will learn about how to import your dataset, how to preprocess the data, training the dataset, and do classification or regression.
we use Regression for prediction of values.
we use classification for predicting which class it belongs to.
